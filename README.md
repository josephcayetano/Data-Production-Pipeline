# Data Production Pipeline
### Overview
This project builds a full MLOps pipeline to predict flight delays, using MLFlow and DVC to make the process automated, repeatable, and ready for deployment.

### MLOps Pipeline & Deployment â€“ Flight Delay Prediction
-	Created a machine learning pipeline using MLFlow and DVC that handles data loading, cleaning, and training a regression model automatically
-	Wrote Python scripts to collect flight data, clean it (e.g., remove duplicates, filter for LAX), and run a polynomial regression model
-	Logged everything in MLFlow including metrics, parameters, model files, and charts under one experiment for easy tracking and reproducibility
